# Image Edge Detection using Canny Algorithm

Edge detection plays a crucial role in various computer vision and image processing applications. The Canny edge detection algorithm is known for its effectiveness in identifying edges while reducing noise and producing thin, well-defined edges.

## Project Outlines 

- Calculates gradient magnitude and direction.
- Applies non-maximum suppression to obtain refined edges.
- Utilizes hysteresis thresholding for edge tracking.
